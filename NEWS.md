# Project status

## General

- Number of species available: 12,684
- Next species update: no more updates in number of models are expected. Thermal range maps and bootstrap are now available for all species.  
- Next steps: model checking and validation; comparison with other modelling projects; improvements and implementation of other approaches (e.g. monotonic responses).  

## 2025-03-07

Diversity tab improved.

## 2025-02-24

Modal and warning added to highlight validation phase. Per species datasets citation added. Contextual tags (e.g. conservation status) added to "species" tab.

## 2024-12-09

All species models are now available. New richness maps will be added in next update.

## 2024-09-01

All tabs are now active and platform is running on server.

## 2024-06-17

New framework adopted for SDMs, thus some updates are done on the map platform. Also, code is now organized in sections for easier update. `leaflet::proxy()` is now used for map updates.

## 2023-11-23

Design of mapping platform started. The structure will be based on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
